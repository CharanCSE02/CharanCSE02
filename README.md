## Work Experience
  ### Elevate Labs || Internship
 • Performed vulnerability assessments and assisted in incident response, improving detection and remediation workflows.
 
• Designed and implemented a Firewall Management System using Python, automating rule validation.

• Configured and managed firewall rules on Kali Linux (UFW) and Windows Defender Firewall to strengthen
endpoint security.

• Carried out real-time network traffic analysis using Wireshark to detect anomalies, data leaks, and suspicious packets.
 
• Published all completed projects and code samples on my CharanCSE02 · GitHub, demonstrating hands-on technical proficiency and documentation skills. 

 ### Boston Institute of Analyst(BIA) || Internship 
• Built foundational knowledge in networking fundamentals, Security principles, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework to support SOC operations and threat hunting.

• Provisioned and configured Kali Linux and Windows 11 virtual machines to create isolated lab environments for hands-on testing.

• Performed network scanning across the lab environment to identify outdated software, exposed services, and open ports; documented findings and recommended remediation steps.

• Investigated application security vulnerabilities and OWASP Top 10 attack vectors through hands-on exploitation and hardening exercises.

• Designed and implemented malware analysis tools for Windows 11 to support both static and dynamic analysis workflows.

• Implemented Snort for IDS/IPS functionality and integrated rulesets to detect common network-based attacks;contributed to firewall rule tuning.

• Deployed and configured Wazuh (agent + server) for endpoint monitoring and log collection to improve visibilityacross virtual endpoints.

## Projects
 # REAL-TIME LOG ANLYSIS  WITH WAZUH & SPLUNK
In this project, I built a security monitoring setup using Wazuh, Suricata, and Splunk inside a Docker environment.

Wazuh was used as a host-based IDS/IPS to collect logs from endpoints, apply rules, and generate real-time alerts.

Suricata was deployed for network intrusion detection and prevention (NIDS/NIPS) to monitor traffic and block suspicious activity.

Splunk was used to collect logs from Wazuh and Suricata, then analyze them with dashboards and event reports.

Everything was deployed in Docker containers to keep the setup secure, isolated, and easy to manage.

I deployed my report here <a href="https://github.com/CharanCSE02/Real-time-log-analysis/"> Project


# Real-Time Firewall Management using python   

Firewall and methodologies, we used tools for network packet sniffer, allow, block and graphical inferface. The tools are python libraries like scapy, gui, sub process, os and json. 

We install python requirements like pip install, scapy, ip tables and os libraries. Then setting environment to all libraries in kali virtual machine.  	

After installation requirements then start with graphical interface and plan. It like scapy will sniffer packets,ip tables for updating firewall rules, os for command execution and json loading rules(or) log storing  

In graphical interface is connect to all libraries to works and user interact easily. Here deployed my project : <a href="https://github.com/CharanCSE02/Build-firewall-using-python "> Project   


# Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering on APK file

Performed static analysis using tools such as APKTool, xxd, keytool, strings, and hash utilities (shasum, md5sum) to gather baseline information about the APK.

Identified critical elements including file signatures, functions, embedded strings, resources, and certificates.

Used the unzip tool to extract and inspect hidden or compiled components such as resources.arsc, classes.dex, and other internal files.

Conducted reverse engineering for advanced static analysis using JADX and Ghidra, revealing deeper details about the application’s structure.

The reverse-engineering process exposed hidden URLs, email endpoints, suspicious permissions, and code execution paths, giving a full understanding of the APK’s behavior and potential risks.

## Projects
 # REAL-TIME LOG ANLYSIS  WITH WAZUH & SPLUNK
In this project, I built a security monitoring setup using Wazuh, Suricata, and Splunk inside a Docker environment.

Wazuh was used as a host-based IDS/IPS to collect logs from endpoints, apply rules, and generate real-time alerts.

Suricata was deployed for network intrusion detection and prevention (NIDS/NIPS) to monitor traffic and block suspicious activity.

Splunk was used to collect logs from Wazuh and Suricata, then analyze them with dashboards and event reports.

Everything was deployed in Docker containers to keep the setup secure, isolated, and easy to manage.

# COFFEE COMMODITY TRADING USING BIG DATA

In this project ,we used python and ML for automation, data visualization, prediction of coffee market.

We collect history coffee trading and present trading. Then using big data to visualization and python automation tools like tkinter. We create web site for prediction of coffee market.

we prediction stock price of coffec trading using with tkinter,numpy and pandas.

# SQL INJECTION PREVENTION SYSTEM 

SQL injection attack is widely used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to system.

A software system is developed to prevent unauthorized access to system using SQL injection attacks.

In this use string Escape based on javascript and php coding to detect malicious SQL query and isolate it before sending to server.

We used X-logs ,AMNESIA,SQL guard and SQL check for automatic isolate query.

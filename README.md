## Projects
 # REAL-TIME LOG ANLYSIS  WITH WAZUH & SPLUNK
In this project, I built a security monitoring setup using Wazuh, Suricata, and Splunk inside a Docker environment.

Wazuh was used as a host-based IDS/IPS to collect logs from endpoints, apply rules, and generate real-time alerts.

Suricata was deployed for network intrusion detection and prevention (NIDS/NIPS) to monitor traffic and block suspicious activity.

Splunk was used to collect logs from Wazuh and Suricata, then analyze them with dashboards and event reports.

Everything was deployed in Docker containers to keep the setup secure, isolated, and easy to manage.

# COFFEE COMMODITY TRADING USING BIG DATA

First, the designed system can automatically collect coffee trading data for New York Arabica coffee futures prices from selected worldwide reports and financial data portals. The Extract, transform and load (ETL) process is adopted to ingest coffee futures trading crawled data into the 3 layers data warehouse. 

We collect history coffee trading and present trading. Then using big data to visualization and python automation tools like tkinter. We create web site for prediction of coffee market.

The future stock returns have some predictive relationships with the publicly available information of present and historical stock market indices. ARIMA is a statistical model which is known to be efficient for time series forecasting especially for short-term prediction.

# MALWARE ANALYSIS WITH WINDOWS EXECUTABLE 

Malware analysis and methodologies, we download malware for Udemy course then we done static analysis and dynamic analysis by using tools are PE studio, PE ID, Dependency walker, PE view, Process monitor, Process explore, Reg shot, ApateDNS, Ghidra.  

Static analysis is used for base overview of executable it will provide by PE studio, PE view, Dependency walker, PE ID and Resource hacker. All tool outcomes are strings, functions, signature and resources.     

Dynamic analysis is used for exploring the executable in virtual environment by Process monitor, Process explore, Reg shot and ApateDNS. All tool outcomes are functionality, behaviour and domains etc.      

Reverse engineering is used for advance static analysis of executable it will provide hide resource, flow of    programming and full overview of malware.
